1) The first Python project here is analyzing four decades of movie data. The data set was downloaded from kaggle. I performed a bunch of cleaning operations to drop duplicates and figure out what percentage of values were mssing in each column. After that i wanted to find out what were the paramters that contributed the most to gross revenue. To do this i generated correlation matrices and visulaized them using seaborn and matplotlib and found that budget of the movie and number of votes received by it were highly correlated to the gross revenue of the movie.
